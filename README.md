## 📊 Model Information

* 📌 Algorithms used: Logistic Regression / Random Forest / etc. *(depending on your implementation)*
* 📁 Input: Cleaned earthquake dataset (magnitude, depth, location, etc.)
* 📈 Output: Predicted earthquake occurrence or severity class

---

## 🧪 Example Dataset

> ⚠️ *Dataset not included in repo.*
> You can use publicly available seismic datasets such as:

* [USGS Earthquake Catalog](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/)
* [Kaggle: Earthquake Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

---

## 📚 Future Improvements

* Integrate real-time data feeds (e.g., USGS APIs)
* Improve feature selection using geospatial correlations
* Deploy the model as a Flask or Streamlit API
